# Swell Journal
Still a work in progress!

Swell Journal currently fetches data from the National Buoy Data Center's API (through Buoy, https://github.com/fitnr/buoyant) and presents it in a human consumable way. Helpful for surfers, ocean adventurers, and people who enjoy looking back to see what the ocean was doing during storms.
